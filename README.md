# Pure Java Virtual Pet Game

The Java pet game that I developed is designed to be user-friendly and easily navigable. Users can quickly understand and interact with the system, as the Command Line Interface (CUI) provides clear and user-friendly messages when incorrect inputs are given. The output layout is clean and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, users have the flexibility to quit the game at any step without encountering error messages, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free gameplay.

The game incorporates a File I/O component, implemented as a Java class, which effectively manages file reading and writing functionalities. It utilizes the File I/O classes covered in lectures and includes more than three functions related to both file reading and writing. Furthermore, the program makes proper use of collections such as List, Map, and Set, showcasing their applicability within the game. The project can be seamlessly opened, compiled, and run using NetBeans IDE, without encountering any issues or runtime errors when provided with expected inputs.

The functionality of the game is comprehensive, encompassing most common features expected in such a project, depending on the team's size. The implemented features are robust, ensuring that any user input is handled flawlessly without throwing exceptions. The game prompts end-users for correct input through informative messages, aiding them in providing accurate inputs. The project compiles successfully without any errors and exhibits a well-structured codebase. With over nine reasonable classes containing numerous methods, the relationships between these classes are clearly presented. The game adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, incorporating concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, the code includes comments for methods, contributing to its readability. Overall, the program demonstrates exceptional robustness, capable of handling various input scenarios without encountering exceptions.
